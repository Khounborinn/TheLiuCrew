Discussion Topics:

1.  Project Progress:

    -   Project is now underway. Live demo has been uploaded to Github Repo
    -   A displayable website can be made through the use of voila
    -   Looking into Flask to see if that is another way to display data
    -   Figuring out a way to show better data (heatmaps, certain charts & graphs)


2.  Official Roles:

    -   Nolan    (Python Programmer in charge of functionality)
    -   Peter    (Python Programmer in charge of functionality of heatmaps and graphs)
    -   Tyler    (Making sure the display on the website is clean and understandable)
    -   Domninic (Organizing the data to make it easier for configuration)

3.  Concerns:

    -   No one has used Flask before so that will take time to learn.
    -   Stress of being at home with the current events around us does take our focus
        away from everything.

4.  Misc:

    - N/A
