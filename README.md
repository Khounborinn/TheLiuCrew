This is the semester long project that we are using the IntelliSense Camera with.


Brief Description: We will create a device that will utalize the depth readings of an Intellisense camera, which then will be used to send messages to vibration devices on the wearers body. 

Final Product: The final product will be able to see the surrounding area and create a proximity barrier that will send a vibration when breached. The product will be worn on the body.
